## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Although it is a simple project, it helped me to learn the use of ForEach , which I used to change the states of rating buttons

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```Js
const checkClick = (ratingClickedId)=>{
    const circles= document.querySelectorAll(".rating-btn")
    circles.forEach(circle => {
        circle.style.backgroundColor ="hsl(213, 19%, 18%)"
        circle.style.color ="hsl(217, 12%, 63%)"
    });
```
